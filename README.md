A collaborative project with photographer Rich Caldwell

We employ p5js, a versatile generative art tool, to transform these photographs. This process involves selecting segments of each image, shuffling them, and then strategically reapplying them to the original picture. This technique not only alters the imagery but also imbues it with a new, modular aesthetic.
Modulo's imagery draws parallels with urban landscapes seen in games like Sim City, and the organized chaos reminiscent of computer chips. This project transcends traditional photography, entering a realm where the familiar becomes uncannily modular. It's a visual exploration that challenges our perception of the everyday.
